# DeFrag DAO

The protocol code-base is open-source and maintained by the community via DeFrag DAO.&#x20;

FRAG is DeFrag's governance token used to:

* Steward the development of the protocol & get community feedback on important parameters such as which NFTs the protocol should accept as collateral and how to price option premiums as insurance for those assets.
* Align incentives between the DeFrag stakeholders (underwriters, borrowers, team), such as option liquidity mining programs.
* Unite all current and future DeFrag products under a single umbrella.
