### Efficacy of Options

One reason it is difficult to take a loan against an NFT is due to the volatile nature and in some cases low liquidity of the asset. What happens if the floor collapses?&#x20;

This is precisely why the protocol makes use of Put Options. The ability to protect and hedge a volatile asset, allows for the protocol to confidently extend loans and provide liquidity to our users.
